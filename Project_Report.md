This project is totally based on machine learning algorithm. The basic purpose of this project is how to train and test data by using Machine Learning Algorithm. We have learned different algorithms to implement the machine learning multinomial and naive bays to train our data to give best accuracy score. As in our project we learned three algorithms to train our data which are KNN, SVM and LC which are used to train our data and test our data to give best accuracy. The best algorithm which is best in the above three algorithms are LC because it is the best algorithm to give best accuracy. As linear classifier achieves this by making a classification decision based on the value of a linear combination of the characteristics. An object's characteristics are also known as feature values and are typically presented to the machine in a vector called a feature vector. Most machine learning models are trained using data from files. This post is a guide to the popular file formats used in open source frameworks for machine learning in Python, including TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, and PySpark. We will also describe how a Feature Store can make the Data Scientistâ€™s life easier by generating training/test data in a file format of choice on a file system of choice.
